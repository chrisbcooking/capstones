    <h2>Hello World!</h2>

      <li>
        <p>
          My name is Chris, and I am currently enrolled in a comprehensive
          Full-Stack Engineering bootcamp. In this program, I’m actively working
          on a variety of hands-on projects, both under the guidance of seasoned
          instructors and independently. <br />
          <br />
          By continuously refining my skills in front-end and back-end
          technologies, I’m gaining valuable experience in web development,
          problem-solving, and effective collaboration. <br />
          <br />
          This immersive environment has not only helped me become more
          proficient in coding but is also preparing me for the challenges and
          opportunities that lie ahead in my career as a Full-Stack Engineer.
